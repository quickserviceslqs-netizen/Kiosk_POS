Build Instructions (For Maintainers)
-----------------------------------
- Rebuild the executable using PyInstaller (ensure `pyinstaller` is installed):
	- `pyinstaller --clean --noconfirm main.spec`
	- After building, `dist\main.exe` (or `dist\main\main.exe` depending on options) will be generated.
- Build the Windows installer with Inno Setup (ISCC):
	- `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" KioskPOS_Installer.iss`
	- This will create the installer in the `dist` folder and include the `assets` folder and `app_icon.ico`.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If dialog icons still show the default icon after packaging, confirm `assets\app_icon.ico` exists and is included in the `dist` installer.
- If using onefile builds, verify the `main.spec` includes the `assets` datas and the icon path for proper sys._MEIPASS extraction.
